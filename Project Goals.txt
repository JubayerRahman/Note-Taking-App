Name of the project is: Note taking app

Objective:
This is a note taking app, my main goal is to make 100 react application in react js with good 
ui(user Interface). I am preety sure I will be a nice frontEnd Developer. Here are a small plan of 
what this app should do.

=> What are the goals of this app?
    It will be a app where you can add your basic daily notes in your day to day life. 
    and they will be saved untill you want to delete them remove them.

=>features:
  1) I want to add a search function in this app so if a user have a lot of nots he can search the 
     title of his desired note the note will show on the top.
  2) I want to add pagination in this app so that if someone addes a lot of notes it will 
     automaticely devide into another page.
  3) I also want to add a special feature so that it a user wants he can change the view option
     of the note showcase layout.

=>Besic Feature:
  There will be some besic Features like: Responsive Layout, Delete Featue, and Edit Function.

=>Loyout Plans:
  I am thinking to start the page with the title and them next to it the search fiels and after thai 
  i want to add the note list Section. There I will add a empty field with a plus symbal to add a
  options for new note. It there are no notes the list will have only one item the add new fiel. if
  it have notes they will show before the "Add New"  options.
  In the add section I will add 2 fields the first one will be the title fiels and the 2nd onw will 
  be the details fiels. When you try to see the note It will show Like a blog post. The Title will
  be in bold and the note will be in regular fonts. I want to use Raleway.
